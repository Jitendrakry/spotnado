I got tired of having to come inside to change the song that
was on Spotify, modify the volume, etc.  I couldn't find any good
iphone apps to do this for me, so I wrote this thing.

It basically just executes applescript that actually does the actions
you tell it, queries information from Spotify, etc.

At first I tried writing it in PHP and just running on Apache, but doing
that means that whatever applescript you execute runs as the Apache user,
which (rightfully) doesn't have permissions to touch Spotify.  So instead
I wrote it with Tornado in Python.
